# MongoYii2

A set of tools and addons bult on top of Yii2's own MongoDB extension to further it's capacity and abilities.

## Why?

Because I found the default MongoDB extension lacked a lot of features needed in programs I made in MongoDB.

**Again:** This is not designed to replace the Yii2 MongoDB but instead compliment it.

## Features

### Formatter

### Validators

#### Validator Map

#### Array Validator

#### MongoDate Validator

#### MongoId Validator

#### NumberValidator

#### RangeValidator

### Active Query Changes

### Mongo Helper
